# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

Initial scaffold implementing the combined load+redo design
(`~/.claude/plans/dbperf_combined_consumer_design.md`):

* One process = one `Sz_init`; N `std::thread` engine workers (default 12),
  each with its own engine handle.
* `SENZING_REDO_PERCENT` (default **20**) splits the pool into
  redo-preferring / load-preferring classes with non-blocking cross-over
  fallback dispatch; endpoints branch cleanly (0 = pure consumer, no redo
  calls; 100 = pure redoer, no AMQP/tokio).
* tokio + lapin AMQP layer inherited from `sz_rabbit_consumer_rust`
  (`prefetch = threads + 2` overshoot to mask the ack round-trip); single
  serial redo fetcher + tiny bounded channel inherited from
  `sz_simple_redoer_rust`, with a 2 s drain-tail re-probe for redo cascades.
* `Engine stats:`-prefixed get_stats logging plus a `Combined stats:` JSON
  status line (rates, MQ depth, `count_redo_records` backlog + EWMA slope,
  measured `redo_share_effective`, derived mode).
* Redo-floor (`__REPAIR__` loop) guard with raw-record sampling.
* Hardened shutdown carried over from both siblings: durable fatal signaling,
  bounded 10 s grace, DLQ vs leave-unacked split for remaining deliveries,
  skip-destroy-on-stuck-worker (leak-on-exit over use-after-free).
* Distroless-cc Dockerfile with the canonical Senzing staging section and the
  `WITH_POSTGRES`/`WITH_MSSQL` build args, matching the sibling repos.
